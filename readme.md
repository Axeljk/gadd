## Introduction

Generic Alliterating Dungeon Drawl is a roguelike with a drawl. It is currently unfinished but offers the ability to travel deeper and deeper into an endless dungeon.

## How to Run

A project.json, gulpfile.js, and \_test batch file are provided for testing on a local machine. Use NPM to download the necessary dependancies and run the batch file. Very hacky.
